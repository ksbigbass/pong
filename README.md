About This Project: Pong
This project demonstrates a streamlined DevOps pipeline for a simple web application. The core is a classic Pong game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Implementation and Workflow
The architecture focuses on efficient delivery and platform flexibility:

Containerization (CI): The application was initially packaged in a Dockerfile to establish a consistent, reproducible local build and execution environment.

Deployment (CD): The static source code is deployed using Vercel's native Git integration to achieve high-speed, scalable delivery across its Edge Network.

This approach successfully separates the local development environment (Docker) from the production hosting platform (Vercel), validating a repeatable and rapid continuous deployment (CD) strategy.
